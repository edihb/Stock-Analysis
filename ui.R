                         A time series is a sequence of data points, typically consisting of successive measurements made over a time interval. Examples of time series are ocean tides, counts of sunspots, and the daily closing value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Time series are very frequently plotted via line charts. Time series are used in statistics, signal processing, pattern recognition, econometrics, mathematical finance, weather forecasting, intelligent transport and trajectory forecasting,earthquake prediction, electroencephalography, control engineering, astronomy, communications engineering, and largely in any domain of applied science and engineering which involves temporal measurements.
                         Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values. While regression analysis is often employed in such a way as to test theories that the current values of one or more independent time series affect the current value of another time series, this type of analysis of time series is not called time series analysis, which focuses on comparing values of a single time series or multiple dependent time series at different points in time.
                         Time series data have a natural temporal ordering. This makes time series analysis distinct from cross-sectional studies, in which there is no natural ordering of the observations (e.g. explaining people's wages by reference to their respective education levels, where the individuals' data could be entered in any order). Time series analysis is also distinct from spatial data analysis where the observations typically relate to geographical locations (e.g. accounting for house prices by the location as well as the intrinsic characteristics of the houses). A stochastic model for a time series will generally reflect the fact that observations close together in time will be more closely related than observations further apart. In addition, time series models will often make use of the natural one-way ordering of time so that values for a given period will be expressed as deriving in some way from past values, rather than from future values (see time reversibility.)
                         Time series analysis can be applied to real-valued, continuous data, discrete numeric data, or discrete symbolic data (i.e. sequences of characters, such as letters and words in the English language).
                         An observed time series can be decomposed into three components: the trend (long term direction), the seasonal (systematic, calendar related movements) and the irregular (unsystematic, short term fluctuations).

                         Time series analysis can be useful to see how a given asset, security or economic variable changes over time or how it changes compared to other variables over the same time period.For example, suppose you wanted to analyze a time series of daily closing stock prices for a given stock over a period of one year. You would obtain a list of all the closing prices for the stock over each day for the past year and list them in chronological order. This would be a one-year, daily closing price time series for the stock.
                         Delving a bit deeper, you might be interested to know if a given stock's time series shows any seasonality, meaning it goes through peaks and valleys at regular times each year. Or you might want to know how a stock's share price changes as an economic variable, such as the unemployment rate, changes.

                         Methods for time series analyses may be divided into two classes: frequency-domain methods and time-domain methods. The former include spectral analysis and recently wavelet analysis; the latter include auto-correlation and cross-correlation analysis. In time domain, correlation analyses can be made in a filter-like manner using scaled correlation, thereby mitigating the need to operate in frequency domain.
                         Additionally, time series analysis techniques may be divided into parametric and non-parametric methods. The parametric approaches assume that the underlying stationary stochastic process has a certain structure which can be described using a small number of parameters (for example, using an autoregressive or moving average model). In these approaches, the task is to estimate the parameters of the model that describes the stochastic process. By contrast, non-parametric approaches explicitly estimate the covariance or the spectrum of the process without assuming that the process has any particular structure.
                         Methods of time series analysis may also be divided into linear and non-linear, and univariate and multivariate.

                         A times series allows you to identify change within a population over time. A time series can also show the impact of cyclical, seasonal and irregular events on the data item being measured.
                         Time series can be classified into two different types: stock and flow.
                         A stock series is a measure of certain attributes at a point in time and can be thought of as “stock takes”.
                         A flow series is a series which is a measure of activity over a given period.
                         The main difference between a stock and a flow series is that flow series can contain effects related to the calendar (trading day effects). Both types of series can still be seasonally adjusted using the same seasonal adjustment process.

Some examples include the sharp escalation in most Retail series which occurs around December in response to the Christmas period, or an increase in water consumption in summer due to warmer weather. Other seasonal effects include trading day effects (the number of working or trading days in a given month differs from year to year which will impact upon the level of activity in that month) and moving holidays (the timing of holidays such as Easter varies, so the effects of the holiday will be experienced in different periods each year).

                         A comparison of original data from the same period in each year does not completely remove all seasonal effects. Certain holidays such as Easter and Chinese New Year fall in different periods in each year, hence they will distort observations. Also, year to year values will be biased by any changes in seasonal patterns that occur over time. For example, consider a comparison between two consecutive March months i.e. compare the level of the original series observed in March for 2000 and 2001. This comparison ignores the moving holiday effect of Easter. Easter occurs in April for most years but if Easter falls in March, the level of activity can vary greatly for that month for some series. This distorts the original estimates. A comparison of these two months will not reflect the underlying pattern of the data. The comparison also ignores trading day effects. If the two consecutive months of March have different composition of trading days, it might reflect different levels of activity in original terms even though the underlying level of activity is unchanged. In a similar way, any changes to seasonal patterns might also be ignored. The original estimates also contains the influence of the irregular component. If the magnitude of the irregular component of a series is strong compared with the magnitude of the trend component, the underlying direction of the series can be distorted.
                         However, the major disadvantage of comparing year to year original data, is lack of precision and time delays in the identification of turning points in a series. Turning points occur when the direction of underlying level of the series changes, for example when a consistently decreasing series begins to rise steadily. If we compare year apart data in the original series, we may miss turning points occurring during the year. For example, if March 2001 has a higher original estimate than March 2000, by comparing these year apart values, we might conclude that the level of activity has increased during the year. However, the series might have increased up to September 2000 and then started to decrease steadily.

                         An original time series shows the actual movements in the data over time. An original series includes any movements due to cyclical, seasonal and irregular events.
                         A cyclical effect is any regular fluctuation in daily, weekly, monthly or annual data. For example, the number of commuters using public transport has regular peaks and troughs during each day of the week, depending on the time of day.
                         A seasonal effect is any variation in data due to calendar related effects which occur systematically at specific seasonal frequencies every year. For example, in Australia employment increases over the Christmas/New Year period, or fruit and vegetable prices can vary depending on whether or not they are 'in-season'.
                         An irregular effect is any movement that occurred at a specific point in time, but is unrelated to a season or cycle. For example, a natural disaster, the introduction of legislation, or a one-off major cultural or sporting event.
                         A seasonally adjusted series involves estimating and removing the cyclical and seasonal effects from the original data. Seasonally adjusting a time series is useful if you wish to understand the underlying patterns of change or movement in a population, without the impact of the seasonal or cyclical effects.
                         For example, employment and unemployment are often seasonally adjusted so that the actual change in employment and unemployment levels can be seen, without the impact of periods of peak employment such as Christmas/New Year when a large number of casual workers are temporarily employed. 
                         A trend series is a seasonally adjusted series that has been further adjusted to remove irregular effects and 'smooth' out the series to show the overall 'trend' of the data over time.
                         For example, the trend is often used when analysing economic indicators such as employment and unemployment levels.

These models are fitted to time series data either to better understand the data or to predict future points in the series (forecasting). They are applied in some cases where data show evidence of non-stationarity, where an initial differencing step (corresponding to the integrated part of the model) can be applied to reduce the non-stationarity.
                          Non-seasonal ARIMA models are generally denoted ARIMA(p, d, q) where parameters p, d, and q are non-negative integers, p is the order of the Autoregressive model, d is the degree of differencing, and q is the order of the Moving-average model. Seasonal ARIMA models are usually denoted ARIMA(p, d, q)(P, D, Q)_m, where m refers to the number of periods in each season, and the uppercase P, D, Q refer to the autoregressive, differencing, and moving average terms for the seasonal part of the ARIMA model.ARIMA models form an important part of the Box-Jenkins approach to time-series modelling.
                          ARIMA models provide another approach to time series forecasting. Exponential smoothing and ARIMA models are the two most widely-used approaches to time series forecasting, and provide complementary approaches to the problem.

Univariate (single vector) ARIMA is a forecasting technique that projects the future values of a series based entirely on its own inertia. Its main application is in the area of short term forecasting requiring at least 40 historical data points. It works best when your data exhibits a stable or consistent pattern over time with a minimum amount of outliers. Sometimes called Box-Jenkins (after the original authors), ARIMA is usually superior to exponential smoothing techniques when the data is reasonably long and the correlation between past observations is stable. If the data is short or highly volatile, then some smoothing method may perform better. If you do not have at least 38 data points, you should consider some other method than ARIMA.

Differencing is an excellent way of transforming a nonstationary series to a stationary one. This is done by subtracting the observation in the current period from the previous one. If this transformation is done only once to a series, you say that the data has been first differenced. This process essentially eliminates the trend if your series is growing at a fairly constant rate. If it is growing at an increasing rate, you can apply the same procedure and difference the data again. Your data would then be second differenced.

                         Autocorrelations are numerical values that indicate how a data series is related to itself over time. More precisely, it measures how strongly data values at a specified number of periods apart are correlated to each other over time. The number of periods apart is usually called the lag. For example, an autocorrelation at lag 1 measures how values 1 period apart are correlated to one another throughout the series. An autocorrelation at lag 2 measures how the data two periods apart are correlated throughout the series. Autocorrelations may range from +1 to -1. A value close to +1 indicates a high positive correlation while a value close to -1 implies a high negative correlation. These measures are most often evaluated through graphical plots called correlagrams. A correlagram plots the auto- correlation values for a given series at different lags. This is referred to as the autocorrelation function and is very important in the ARIMA method.

Pure models imply that the structure consists only of AR or MA parameters - not both.

For example, ARIMA(2,1,1) means that you have a second order autoregressive model with a first order moving average component whose series has been differenced once to induce stationarity.

                         Exponential smoothing is a rule of thumb technique for smoothing time series data, particularly for recursively applying as many as 3 Low-pass filters with exponential window functions. Such techniques have broad application that is not intended to be strictly accurate or reliable for every situation. It is an easily learned and easily applied procedure for approximately calculating or recalling some value, or for making some determination based on prior assumptions by the user, such as seasonality. Like any application of repeated low-pass filtering, the observed phenomenon may be an essentially random process, or it may be an orderly, but noisy, process. Whereas in the simple moving average the past observations are weighted equally, exponential window functions assign exponentially decreasing weights over time. The use of three filters is based on empirical evidence and broad application, as well as its role in prime number theory as the second most common prime number and extensive use in numerology.
                         Exponential smoothing is commonly applied to smooth data, as many window functions are in signal processing, acting as low-pass filters to remove high frequency noise. This method parrots Poisson's use of recursive exponential window functions in convolutions from the 19th century, as well as Kolmogorov and Zurbenko's use of recursive moving averages from their studies of turbulence in the 1940s.

With the additive method, the seasonal component is expressed in absolute terms in the scale of the observed series, and in the level equation the series is seasonally adjusted by subtracting the seasonal component. Within each year the seasonal component will add up to approximately zero. With the multiplicative method, the seasonal component is expressed in relative terms (percentages) and the series is seasonally adjusted by dividing through by the seasonal component. Within each year, the seasonal component will sum up to approximately m.

Indeed, anywhere that there are problems of prediction, classification or control, neural networks are being introduced. This sweeping success can be attributed to a few key factors:
                         Power:Neural networks are very sophisticated modeling techniques capable of modeling extremely complex functions. In particular, neural networks are nonlinear (a term which is discussed in more detail later in this section). For many years linear modeling has been the commonly used technique in most modeling domains since linear models have well-known optimization strategies. Where the linear approximation was not valid (which was frequently the case) the models suffered accordingly. Neural networks also keep in check the curse of dimensionality problem that bedevils attempts to model nonlinear functions with large numbers of variables.
                         Ease of use:Neural networks learn by example. The neural network user gathers representative data, and then invokes training algorithms to automatically learn the structure of the data. Although the user does need to have some heuristic knowledge of how to select and prepare data, how to select an appropriate neural network, and how to interpret the results, the level of user knowledge needed to successfully apply neural networks is much lower than would be the case using (for example) some more traditional nonlinear statistical methods. 
                         Neural networks are also intuitively appealing, based as they are on a crude low-level model of biological neural systems. In the future, the development of this neurobiological modeling may lead to genuinely intelligent computers.

The main branch of Artificial Intelligence research in the 1960s -1980s produced Expert Systems. These are based upon a high-level model of reasoning processes (specifically, the concept that our reasoning processes are built upon manipulation of symbols). It became rapidly apparent that these systems, although very useful in some domains, failed to capture certain key aspects of human intelligence. According to one line of speculation, this was due to their failure to mimic the underlying structure of the brain. In order to reproduce intelligence, it would be necessary to build systems with a similar architecture.

Each neuron is a specialized cell which can propagate an electrochemical signal. The neuron has a branching input structure (the dendrites), a cell body, and a branching output structure (the axon). The axons of one cell connect to the dendrites of another via a synapse. When a neuron is activated, it fires an electrochemical signal along the axon. This signal crosses the synapses to other neurons, which may in turn fire. A neuron fires only if the total signal received at the cell body from the dendrites exceeds a certain level (the firing threshold).

Each synapse actually contains a gap, with neurotransmitter chemicals poised to transmit a signal across the gap. One of the most influential researchers into neurological systems (Donald Hebb) postulated that learning consisted principally in altering the strength of synaptic connections. For example, in the classic Pavlovian conditioning experiment, where a bell is rung just before dinner is delivered to a dog, the dog rapidly learns to associate the ringing of a bell with the eating of food. The synaptic connections between the appropriate part of the auditory cortex and the salivation glands are strengthened, so that when the auditory cortex is stimulated by the sound of the bell the dog starts to salivate. Recent research in cognitive science, in particular in the area of nonconscious information processing, have further demonstrated the enormous capacity of the human mind to infer (learn) simple input-output covariations from extremely complex stimuli (e.g., see Lewicki, Hill, and Czyzewska, 1992).

                         It receives a number of inputs (either from original data, or from the output of other neurons in the neural network). Each input comes via a connection that has a strength (or weight); these weights correspond to synaptic efficacy in a biological neuron. Each neuron also has a single threshold value. The weighted sum of the inputs is formed, and the threshold subtracted, to compose the activation of the neuron (also known as the post-synaptic potential, or PSP, of the neuron).
                         The activation signal is passed through an activation function (also known as a transfer function) to produce the output of the neuron.

Actually, the step function is rarely used in artificial neural networks, as will be discussed. Note also that weights can be negative, which implies that the synapse has an inhibitory rather than excitatory effect on the neuron: inhibitory neurons are found in the brain.

If a network is to be of any use, there must be inputs (which carry the values of variables of interest in the outside world) and outputs (which form predictions, or control signals). Inputs and outputs correspond to sensory and motor nerves such as those coming from the eyes and leading to the hands. However, there also can be hidden neurons that play an internal role in the network. The input, hidden and output neurons need to be connected together.

A simple network has a feedforward structure: signals flow from inputs, forwards through any hidden units, eventually reaching the output units. Such a structure has stable behavior. However, if the network is recurrent (contains connections back from later to earlier neurons) it can be unstable, and has very complex dynamics. Recurrent networks are very interesting to researchers in neural networks, but so far it is the feedforward structures that have proved most useful in solving real problems.

The hidden and output layer neurons are each connected to all of the units in the preceding layer.

The activation value is passed through the activation function to produce the output of the neuron.

Numeric data is scaled into an appropriate range for the network, and missing values can be substituted for using the mean value (or other statistic) of that variable across the other available training cases (see Bishop, 1995).

There are some heuristic guidelines, which relate the number of cases needed to the size of the network (the simplest of these says that there should be ten times as many cases as connections in the network). Actually, the number needed is also related to the (unknown) complexity of the underlying function which the network is trying to model, and to the variance of the additive noise. As the number of variables increases, the number of cases required increases nonlinearly, so that with even a fairly small number of variables (perhaps fifty or less) a huge number of cases are required. This problem is known as the curse of dimensionality,and is discussed further later in this section.

                         With the advent of the digital computer, stock market prediction has since moved into the technological realm. The most prominent technique involves the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and Genetic Algorithms. Scholars found bacterial chemotaxis optimization method may perform better than GA.ANNs can be thought of as mathematical function approximators. The use of ANN simulates how human brain functions, by feeding computers with massive data to mimic human thinking. The most common form of ANN in use for stock market prediction is the feed forward network utilising the backward propagation of errors algorithm to update the network weights. These networks are commonly referred to as Backpropagation networks. Another form of ANN that is more appropriate for stock prediction is the time recurrent neural network (RNN) or time delay neural network (TDNN). Examples of RNNN and TDNN are the Elman, Jordan, and Elman-Jordan networks. (See the Elman And Jordan Networks).
                         For stock prediction with ANNs, there are usually two approaches taken for forecasting different time horizons: independent and joint. The independent approach employs a single ANN for each time horizon, for example, 1-day, 2-day, or 5-day. The advantage of this approach is that network forecasting error for one horizon won't impact the error for another horizon—since each time horizon is typically a unique problem. The joint approach, however, incorporates multiple time horizons together so that they are determined simultaneously. In this approach, forecasting error for one time horizon may share its error with that of another horizon, which can decrease performance. There are also more parameters required for a joint model, which increases the risk of overfitting.
                         Of late, the majority of academic research groups studying ANNs for stock forecasting seem to be using an ensemble of independent ANNs methods more frequently, with greater success. An ensemble of ANNs would use low price and time lags to predict future lows, while another network would use lagged highs to predict future highs. The predicted low and high predictions are then used to form stop prices for buying or selling. Outputs from the individual low and high networks can also be input into a final network that would also incorporate volume, intermarket data or statistical summaries of prices, leading to a final ensemble output that would trigger buying, selling, or market directional change. A major finding with ANNs and stock prediction is that a classification approach (vs. function approximation) using outputs in the form of buy(y=+1) and sell(y=-1) results in better predictive reliability than a quantitative output such as low or high price.This is explained by the fact that an ANN can predict class better than a quantitative value as in function approximation—since ANNs occasionally learn more about the noise in the input data.
                         Since NNs require training and can have a large parameter space, it is useful to modify the network structure for optimal predictive ability.

1.General  index  is  a  number  that  measure  the  relative  value of  a  section  of  share  market.  It  reflects  the  total  economic condition  of  the  market. 
  If  the  general  index  goes  down then  it  means  the  economic  condition  of  that  particular market is relatively in poor condition. 
2.The Net asset value (NAV) of a company is the company‟s total  assets  minus  its  total  liabilities.  NAV  is  typically calculated on a per-share basis.
  NAV= (Net asset of a company− Liability)/ Total number of outstanding share
  NAV is  also  calculated  each  day  by  taking  the  last  market value  of  all  securities  owned  plus  all  other  assets  such  as cash,  subtracting  all  liabilities  and  then  dividing  the  result by the total number of shares outstanding.
  NAV reflects the financial condition of the company. We can judge the company reputation by the NAV.
3.The P/E ratio makes a relationship between the share price and the company‟s earnings. 
  The P/E ratio of a share is a measure of the price paid for a share relative to the annual net income or profit earned by the firm per share.
  P/E ratio = Share Price / Earnings Per Share. 
  If  P/E  ratio  rises  then  there  is  a  tendency  of  the  company share  price  falls,  the  higher  P/E  ratio  then  the  higher probability to decrease the price.
4.Earnings per share (EPS) is a comparison tool between two companies. 
  Earnings  per  shareserve  as  an  indicator  of a company's profitability.
  EPS =Net Earnings / Number of Outstanding Shares.
